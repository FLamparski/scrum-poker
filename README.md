# scrum poker but serverless

**play some poker (success not guaranteed): https://scrumpoker.lol**

a scrum poker app using aws and the serverless framework. spun off from a hackday project i did
some time ago.

i'd put a proper licence here but for now it's probably not worth the effort. so for now you can
enjoy this source-available mess.
