# scrum poker but serverless

a scrum poker app using aws and the serverless framework. spun off from a hackday project i did
some time ago.

i'd put a proper licence here but for now it's probably not worth the effort. so for now you can
enjoy this source-available mess. oh and i will probably add a link to a prod-ish version of this
once i'm happy with it.
